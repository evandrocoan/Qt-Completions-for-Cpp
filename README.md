> Note: All the string with bold below is used to specify which case it should begin with.

| Component Usage    | Package display          | Package Type |
| :-------------:    | :-------------:          | :-----:      |
| **s**etMaximumSize | `setMaximumSize();`      |  Methods     |
| **Q**tWidgets      | `#include <QtWidgets>`   |  Modules     |
| **Q**Label         | `QLabel`                 |  Classes     |
| **Q**Audio         | `#include <QAudio>`      |  Namespaces  |
| **I-**QLabel       |  `QLabel* labe = new QLabel();` | Instances |

> **Note:** You need to use **upper case** `I-` to get instances completion.  

> Advice: This completion package is meant for Qt for C++ and not C++. You can disable this package if working on C++ alone.
